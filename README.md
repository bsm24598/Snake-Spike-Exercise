# Snake-Spike-Exercise

School assignment/spike exercise to learn how to manipulate objects using React. Every member of our team had to create a different and unique version of snake to learn how to use our chosen tech stack for our final project. This is my version of snake while learning how to use React after reviewing multiple online tutorials. This is a simple spike exercise designed to get familiar with a new framework/language.
